# D&D Tools
D&D Tools is a C# application made to help with D&D campaigns and character management.
It's made with D&D 3.5 in mind, and mostly suited to [my](https://github.com/DiegoG1019/) needs.

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/eRDDjXdf/dd-tools)

My goal with this application is to provide a flexible task organizer and data keeper to use in D&D campaigns. This application is heavily oriented in giving the user the maximum amount of control possible, from creating new feats, characters, things not included in the book, etc.

## Versioning Scheme
