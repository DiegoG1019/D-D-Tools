# D&D Tools
D&D Tools is a C# App made to help with D&D campaigns management.
It's made with D&D 3.5 in mind, and mostly suited to [my](https://github.com/DiegoG1019/) needs.

## Versioning Scheme
W.Z.Y.X
- W - Big changes that affect the entire structure and structure plan of the program
- Y - Big changes that add significantly more features to the program. Releases will usually be made upon a change to this number
- Z - Small changes that add or remove features, and usually scale up to a change to Y
- X - Minor changes that usually include patches or even minor spelling fixes

## Installation



## Usage
To compile an executable, assuming the folder structure remains the same, simply run the compile.bat

(This is made this way because I don't have VisualStudio, and I haven't gotten around to setup a better method of project management, mostly due to internet limitations)

## Contributing
